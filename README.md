# Protocols
## Diameter is an authentication, authorization, and accounting
protocol for computer networks. It evolved from the earlier RADIUS
protocol. It belongs to the application layer protocols in the internet protocol suite.

Diameter Applications extend the base protocol by adding new commands and/or attributes,
such as those for use with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
